Maintaining that protection is challenging and requires those engaged in the analysis, planning and management of it to be highly capable and knowledgeable. The MSc Critical Infrastructure programme is designed to develop high-level capability and knowledge in professionals responsible for CI protection. Critical Infrastructure supports all societies and encompasses the ‘facilities, systems, sites, information, people, networks and processes, necessary for a country to function and upon which daily life depends. It also includes some functions, sites and organisations which are not critical to the maintenance of essential services, but which need protection due to the potential danger to the public (civil nuclear and chemical sites for example).’(UK Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure – CPNI).

                Data Analytics is an exciting field of rapid development. Data is everywhere and continuing to grow massively, creating huge growth in demand for qualified experts to be able to extract the real benefit from the data. The role of a data scientist is highly diverse overlapping many areas from computer science to the fundamentals of mathematics, statistics, modelling and analytics while also requiring the right skills to be able to see the detail, solve the problem (having specified the problem!), and communicate effectively the findings to colleagues to empower them to make decisions. The diversity of data analytics opens up many job opportunities from working in software companies, healthcare, banking, insurance, policing, tech companies to applying your knowledge to intelligent buildings and behaviour analytics of customers. The programme provides a balanced route to learning through a blend of academic study and lab sessions, with a heavy focus on practical engagement with industry. In the first and second semesters, you will study 6 modules full-time which include opportunities for blended and collaborative learning. In the third semester, you will undertake a significant industry-based project.

                Nowadays, it is almost impossible to come across an engineering field that is not related to information processing. An unprecedented level of importance that information has in modern societies is mainly due to the rapid development of communication technology. Exchanging data between heterogeneous players, from humans, through autonomous cars to robots, is the fundamental prerequisite for any kind of cooperative activities. This would not be possible without sophisticated data processing and communication systems. Clearly, the information goes hand in hand with communication technology, so these areas are merged into the master study program Information and Communication Technologies.

The field of digital transformation affects all areas of the company and all sectors without exception. And within these transformative processes, there is an element that represents a true competitive advantage: the correct management of data. Big data has become the buzzword in the organizational arena. In recent years, the most requested positions by companies are those of a specialist in big data in the field of the company. According to the World Economic Forum, in its report The Future of Jobs, by 2022 85% of companies will have adopted big data technologies. This demand for professionals is difficult to cover because there is a double gap in the profiles sought: on the one hand, technical profiles specialized in big data do not usually have practical business knowledge; on the other hand, professionals in different areas of the company rarely have the necessary technical knowledge.

In essence, they are problem solvers with the ability to take an existing software system and creatively refine, enhance and transform it into something even better. This degree programme is designed to equip you with the analytical, reasoning and practical skills you will need to design, develop and deploy large software systems. Plus, our project-based learning approach enables you to craft a degree pathway that fits your own areas of interest. You could find yourself working on anything from apps to virtual and augmented reality; lifesaving smart medical implants to consumer space travel or automated intelligence. Employer experience is embedded into this course and allows students to engage and learn from prospective employers from day one. Through placements, sponsored projects and hackathons, you will engage with employers and begin making a difference in real-world problems.
